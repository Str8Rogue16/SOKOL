# DiscordAlerts
Alerts to Discord when identified twitter accounts post on twitter. 

This will be built off of Python with an API to Twitter and an alert tied to discord. 
This will allow a discord notification when an identified and tagged twitter account posts on twitter without the need to be consistantly scrolling twitter.
Alerts will be based off of Twitter (X) handles at first and as it becomes more sophisticated add keywords and "#" to the target. 

Currently built with: 
* Python


Will need to create a database to scrape any images or videography that is posted with the tweet/s.
Along with that will be the scraping and geolocating the tweet and any embedded metrics of images.
